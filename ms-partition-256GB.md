For the three-tier example, a 192 GB server (database server) with one logical disk (on RAID10) was ordered, as well as a 32 GB server (application server) with one logical disk (on RAID 1). Both servers come with one large file system equal to the total size of disks.

Regarding storage, the server does not require any further installation steps.
