# 3. Partitioning and file systems

For the three-tier example, a 192 GB server (database server) with one logical disk (on RAID10) was ordered, as well as a 32 GB server (application server) with one logical disk (on RAID 1). Both servers come with one large file system equal to the total size of disks.
