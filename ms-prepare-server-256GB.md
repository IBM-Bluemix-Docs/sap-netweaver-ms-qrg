# 2. Preparing your server for your SAP installation (256 GB)
{: #prepare_256GB}

A public IP is used for remote access, which means you can connect to your servers through a Remote Desktop (RDP) client (for example, Windowsâ€™ MSTSC). Use the public IP addresses that are displayed in the Device List (under the Device menu) for your device. The root passwords for your servers are also displayed; be sure to click **Show Password** to see them.
